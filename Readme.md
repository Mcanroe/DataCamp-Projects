# Analysing Nobel Prize Winners

This is a datacamp project that uses a Nobel Prize Winners Dataset.
The goal of this project is to answer the following questions and create visualisations where apt;
  
  Q1.What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?
     Store your answers as string variables top_gender and top_country.
     
  Q2.Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?
     Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.
     
  Q3.Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
     Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.

  Q4.Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
     Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.

  Q5.Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
     Store the full names in a list named repeat_list.
